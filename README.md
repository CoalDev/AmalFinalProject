# AmalFinalProject
#### I've done the Electrical engineering final project in 10th grade instead of 12th grade, this is the code.

### The project is all about "How to make children want to help out with the house chores?"
#### so me and yelena (design student) thought about how can we create something for children that they will like, we new that we had to create a game, but for what?
#### we decided that helping with the laundry will be great and very helpful, we decided about a game idea
#### You start by picking a color out of three (You can see them in the BMP or PNG folder), once you pick a color there is a countdown of 5 seconds, after the countdown a timer starts and a song starts which will motivate the child to compete, he will need to beat his own best record in hanging the laundry or beat his siblings, at the end it either shows in red the high score of that player which means you didn't break the record, or it will show a grean high score which means you beat the high score, the storage of scores works on the EEPROM.
##### I had to create almost everything from scratch, it was hard but also very fun and challenging.
I uploaded this now because I just remembered about it, wanted to add it to my CV and to keep the memory alive somewhat.
